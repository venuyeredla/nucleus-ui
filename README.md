# JavascriptNotes
1. Javascript single threaded, dynamically typed interpreted language. 
2. Dom manipulation and event handling is the important aspect of language.


Data types :
Primitive: Boolean, Number,BigInt String, Null, Undefined, Symbol.
Abstract(Using new keyword) : Arrays, Objects, functions, Dates, Maths,
Collections/Containers : Set, Map

Array methods: array.sort(), shift,unshift, Slice(reading), Splice(Altering), push,pop,filter,includes
String methods: substr(idx,number of chars),substring(idxs,idxe)


# Creation of Objects
1. Object constructor: var object = new Object(); then add propertis and methods.
2. Object's create method:  var object = Object.create(null);
3. Object literal syntax:  
    `var object = {
     name: "Sudheer",
     age: 34
    };`
4. Function constructor: 
    `function Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = 21;
}
var object = new Person("Sudheer");`
5. Function constructor with prototype:
6. With class definition and new operator

# Loop or iteration  : 
1. for 
2. for in -> through properties of object
3. for of ->  throught Arrays, Strings, Maps, NodeLists.
4. while
5. forEach -> Sets, Maps.

# functions & Reflection
1. Functions first class objects means we can pass an argument or return from function. 
    a. First order or higher order functions.  
    b. Immediate invoke function expression (IIFE)- (function(){})();
    c. Function Currying 
    d. Clousures.
    e. arrow functions for implmenting lambdas.
    f. Pure function - Doesn't change state of anything.
 2. Defining 
    a. function name(...args) {code}
    b. Programmtically constructing function 
        `const myFunction = new Function("a", "b", "return a * b");`

2. Reflection in javascripts - All Functions are Methods
    a. call()
    b. apply()
    c. bind() - an object can borrow a method from another object.
    d. Closures.


# Asynchronus event handling
  1. call back after event completed.
  2. Promises
  3. async/wait
    "async and await make promises easier to write"
     async makes a function return a Promise
     await makes a function wait for a Promise
  4. subscribers.
  5. Running at intervals

# Object models.
   BOM : Window, Screen, Location, History, Navigator, Popup alert, Timing, Cookies.
   DOM : Nodes, Elements, Events, Forms, Animations, CSS

# Web API.
    Forms, History, Storage(Local storage, Session storage), 
    Web worker : 
    Fetch API(No need for XMLHttpRequest anymore.)
    Server-sent-Events.

# Web component
 Web Components is a suite of different technologies allowing you to create reusable custom elements — with their functionality 
 encapsulated away from the rest of your code — and utilizes them in your web apps.
 1. Creating custom tages,
 2. Using Shadow dom(Shadow host ,shadow Root, attaching SR to sh in open(Accessible from main dom JS.) or closed mode.)
 3. Using templates.
 4. Virtual DOM by Reactjs or VueJs

# Component
    is a reusable custom element with encapsulated functionality and it's own template,style and script. These are useful for building 
    complex ui applications
# Directive 
    is a command for either libraray or browser for rendering element(process a request)


# Template for Frameworks features
 1. Building single page application
 2. Routing for handling multiple views.
 2. HTTP API for hanlding communication with server. 
 3. Data binding. i.e DOM manipulation
 4. Event handling - Event publishing ,propagation or delegation.
 5. Form validation
 6. Component library.


# Nodejs
    NodeJs is server and npm or npx are package/module management tools.

    $> npm [--help]
        Options: search,install,unistall,update,ls
    install $> npm install  <pkg>        (or) npm install express -g 
    uninsall $>npm uninstall <pkg>
    gloabal $>  npm install --global <pkg>

    1. By default npm installs dependencies in local mode(node_modules).
    2. Locally deployed packages are accessible via require() method. 

    Nodejs web framework::
    $>npm install express --save

    Important tools & frameworks
    1. Babel -- comples ecma6 & JSX to normal javascript supported by browsers.
    2. Webpack  -- module budler and compiles javascript modules.
